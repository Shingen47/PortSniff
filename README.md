# PortSniff

PortSniff is a port scanner software detecting open ports on a system. It sends messages to ports, identifying entry points for data exchange. 
Used by admins for network management, and by security experts for vulnerability detection. Unlawful use is unethical and illegal.

A port scanner is a software tool or program used to examine a target computer or network for open ports. Ports are like communication endpoints on a computer that different services or applications use to send and receive data. Each port is associated with a specific service or protocol.

The purpose of a port scanner is to identify which ports on a target system are actively listening for incoming connections. This information is valuable for various purposes, including network administration, security assessment, and troubleshooting. Port scanners can be used by system administrators to ensure that only necessary services are running and exposed to the network. Additionally, security professionals use port scanners to identify potential vulnerabilities in systems by locating open ports that might indicate weak points in the network's defenses.

Port scanners operate by systematically sending connection requests to various ports on the target system and observing the responses
